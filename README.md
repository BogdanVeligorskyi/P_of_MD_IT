Repository for individual task from discipline "Programming of Mobile Devices" (Програмування мобільних пристроїв)

In the process of development Android Studio, Java and Glide library were used.

The purpose of individual task was demonstration any library or framework. 
I decided to choose Glide library, which helps process images, and create gallery application.
